# QTM-ECDS Social Media Workshop

This repository contains the replication materials for the QTM-ECDS Social Media Workshop by Josh Fjelstul, Ph.D.

# Workshop Description

Participants will need basic familiarity with R, including how to open and write an R script and how to work with data frames. The workshop will be interactive and participants should bring a laptop with an up-to-date version of R installed.
 
This workshop will cover how to use the Twitter API via R. We will scrape tweets using the API and use the data to construct network graphs and conduct text analysis, including topic modeling. We will also create a simple web app using Shiny to visualize Twitter networks based on retweets, mentions, and replies.
